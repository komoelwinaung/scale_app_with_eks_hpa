Testing Env: Ubuntu, Visual Studio Code, AWS ap-southeast-1 region

First of all, we will need to make sure AWS cli, eks and required configuration.

Second, configure step by step according to documentation.

Lastly, should avoid using micro EC2 instance in eks nodes, faced error when create pods and load testing.

Have fun!!!
